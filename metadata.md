## Lookups {#lookups}

Used for lookup values of all category based columns

-   **tableName**: Name of the Table

-   **columnName**: Name for the column

-   **value**: Name of the value

-   **description**: Name of the description

## Naming conventions

-   **table names**: Table names use UpperCamelCase.
-   **variable and category names**: Both variables and variable categories use lowerCamelCase. Do not use special characters (only uppercase, lowercase letters and numbers). Reason: variable and category names can be combined to generate derived variables. Using special characters will generate non-allowable characters - see below.
-   **variables in Wide tables**: Wide tables use `_` to concatenate variables from long tables.
-   **variable order** if a multiple measurement take place on different dates this has a natural form in the long table format, however in the pivot wider format this can be ambiguous. In this case, show a `analysisDate` followed by a series of measurements taken on that date ex(`temp_c_singleton`) then another `covidN1_PPMV_mean` followed by more measurements ex(`covidN1_PPMV_mean`)
-   **merging Tables** : when you merge tables concatenate column names with`__`. So `dateTime` from the `Sample` table becomes `Sample__dateTime`.
-   **Derived, summary or transformed measures**: Follows the same approach as naming variable and category names, except use a `_` when concatenating variable or category names. These three types measures are generated to summarize or transform one or more variables. An example is calculating the mean value of one or more SARS-CoV-2 regions. Normalization and standardization are other examples of a transformed measure.
-   **date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (24 hour format, in UTC)
-   **location**: [well known text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) for polygon.
-   **versions**: [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org)

## Examples of how to generate wide variable and category names

### 1) Simple viral region report

A long table would represent viral measures of:

``` {.markdown}
date = 2021-01-15
type = covidN1
unit = vcPMMoV
aggregation = mean
value = 40
```

``` {.markdown}
date = 2021-01-15
type = covidN2
unit = vcPMMoV
aggregation = mean
value = 42
```

In a long table as:

| date       | type    | unit    | aggregation | value |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 2021-01-15 | covidN1 | vcPPMoV | mean        | 40    |
| 2021-01-15 | covidN2 | vcPPMoV | mean        | 42    |

A wide table would represent the same measurement as:

``` {.markdown}
    WWMeasure__covidN1_PPMV_mean = 40
    WWMeasure__covidN2_PPMV_mean = 42
```

In a wide table as:

| date       | WWMeasure\_\_covidN1_vcPPMoV_mean | WWMeasure\_\_covidN2_vcPPMoV_mean |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 2021-01-15 | 40                                | 42                                |

### 2) Derived measure

To report a mean value of existing covidN1 and covidN2 measures:

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    type = covidN1
    unit = ml
    aggregation = mean
    value = 42
```

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    type = covidN2
    unit = ml
    aggregation = mean
    value = 40
```

Represent the derived measure as:

long table format

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    type = covidN1covidN2
    unit = ml
    aggreation = mean
    value = 41
```

| date       | type           | unit | aggregation | value |
|------------|----------------|------|-------------|-------|
| 2021-01-15 | covidN1covidN2 | ml   | mean        | 41    |

or, gitwide table format

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    covidN1covidN2_ml_mean = 41
```

-   Viral SARS-CoV-2 copies per reference copies.

### 3) Transformed measure

To report mean viral copies of mean value N1 and N2 per viral copies of PMMoV:

Represent the derived measure as:

long table description

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    covidN1covidN2 = 2
