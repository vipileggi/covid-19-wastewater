## Lookup

Used for lookup values of all category based columns

-   **tableName**: Name of the Table

-   **columnName**: Name for the column

-   **value**: Name of the value

-   **description**: Name of the description

## Naming conventions

-   **Table names**: Table names use UpperCamelCase.

-   **Variable and category names**: Both variables and variable categories use lowerCamelCase. Do not use special characters (only uppercase, lowercase letters and numbers). Reason: variable and category names can be combined to generate derived variables. Using special characters will generate non-allowable characters - see below. Category names a maximum of 7 characters to allow concatenation of four categories into a single variaable to comply with ArcGIS 31 character maximum for variable names. 

-   **Variables in wide tables**: Wide tables use `_` to concatenate variables from long tables.

-   **Variable order** If a multiple measurement take place on different dates this has a natural form in the long table format, however in the pivot wider format this can be ambiguous. In this case, show a `reportDate` followed by a series of measurements taken on that date (e.g. `covN1_PPMV_mean`) followed by more measurements (e.g. `covN2_PPMV_mean`)

-   **Merging tables** : Merging tables into a wide table requires additional steps when a variable does not have an unique name (when the variable name appears in more than one table). For example, variables such as `dateTime`, `notes`, `description`, `type`, `version` and `ID` variables such as `sampleID` are used in several tables. Use the following approach:

    -   Variable that are not unique (they are in more than one table): add the table name to the variable by concatenate column names with `_`. e.g. `dateTime` from the `Sample` table becomes `Sample_dateTime`.
    -   Variable that are unique (they in only one table in the entire OMD). No variable name changes are needed.

-   **Derived, summary or transformed measure**: These measures are generated to summarize or transform one or more variables. Naming convention follows the same approach as naming variable and category names, except use a `_` when concatenating variable or category names.  Examples of derived measure the calculation of a mean mean value of one or more SARS-CoV-2 regions. Normalization and standardization are other examples of a transformed measure. Typically derived, summary or transform measures are not reported, rather the preferred reporting approach reporting the underlying measures. 

-   **Date time**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (24 hour format, in UTC)

-   **Location**: [well known text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) for polygon.

-   **Version**: [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org)

## Examples of how to generate wide variable and category names

### 1) Simple viral region report

A long table would represent viral measures of:

``` {.markdown}
date = 2021-01-15
type = covN1
unit = nPMMoV
aggregation = mean
value = 40
```

``` {.markdown}
date = 2021-01-15
type = covN2
unit = nPMMoV
aggregation = mean
value = 42
```

In a long table as:

| date       | type  | unit   | aggregation | value |
|------------|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 2021-01-15 | covN1 | nPPMoV | mean        | 40    |
| 2021-01-15 | covN2 | nPPMoV | mean        | 42    |

A wide table would represent the same measurement as:

``` {.markdown}
    covidN1_PPMV_mean = 40
    covidN2_PPMV_mean = 42
```

In a wide table as:

| date       | covN1_nPPMoV_mean | covN2_nPPMoV_mean |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2021-01-15 | 40                | 42                |

### 2) Derived measure

To report a mean value of existing covidN1 and covidN2 measures:

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    type = covN1
    unit = ml
    aggregation = mean
    value = 42
```

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    type = covN2
    unit = ml
    aggregation = mean
    value = 40
```

Represent the derived measure as:

long table format

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    type = covN1covN2
    unit = ml
    aggreation = mean
    value = 41
```

| date       | type       | unit | aggregation | value |
|------------|------------|------|-------------|-------|
| 2021-01-15 | covN1covN2 | ml   | mean        | 41    |

or, wide table format

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    covN1covN2_ml_mean = 41
```

-   Viral SARS-CoV-2 copies per reference copies.

### 3) Transformed measure

To report mean viral copies of mean value N1 and N2 per viral copies of PMMoV:

Represent the derived measure as:

long table description

``` {.markdown}
    date = 2021-01-15
    covN1covN2 = 2
    unit = PPMV
    type = meanNr
```

or,

wide table format

``` {.markdown}
    covidN1covidN2_PPMV_meanNr = 2
```
